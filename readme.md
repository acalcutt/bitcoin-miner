Bitcoin JavaScript Miner
========================

What is it?
-----------
It's a bitcoin miner that works from the browser. It utilizes the Stratum protocol to connect to a mining pool and will mine for as long as you want.

How do I use it?
----------------

All you need to do is open the webpage and it should start mining right away. You can configure the wallet addresss to something that isn't mine. If you were sneaky, you could even repackage this so that it works as an XSS attack. Turn a poorly secured website's visitors into your personal mining rig.

Does It Really Mine Bitcoins?
-----------------------------

Yes, but it's so inneficient that you may not actually be able to mine anything depending on how the pool distributes shares. In order for it to be effective you may have to conistently run it to make sure you're constantly getting shares, so pick an appropriate mining pool if you want to even attempt to actually make some bitcoins.
